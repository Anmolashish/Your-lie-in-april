            <p>Dear Kōsei,</p>
            <p>
              I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise to perform with you again.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise to go on more dates with you.
            </p>
            <p>I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise to marry you.</p>
            <p>
              But most of all, I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise to grow old
              with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was so scared. The first time I saw you perform, I was
              captivated. The way your fingers danced across the keys, the way
              you poured your soul into the music—it was the most beautiful
              thing I'd ever seen.
            </p>
            <p>
              I lied. I lied so I could be part of your world. I wanted you to
              notice me, to remember me. Even if it was just as the weird girl
              who forced you to accompany her.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for sharing your music with me. Thank you for letting me
              be part of your journey back to the piano. Thank you for giving
              color to my world, even as I tried to bring color back to yours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please don't forget me. Promise me you'll keep playing, that
              you'll keep living with all the passion you put into your music.
            </p>
            <p>With love,</p>
            <p>Kaori</p>
